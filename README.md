# hello there. üëã

I am Kenniku.

When I am not out and about, I am usually dabbling in code, reading docs or just being a complete nerd!


### About Me:

- Currently focusing on mastering JavaScript and Rails. 
- With a background in graphic design, I bring a unique perspective to coding and development.
- Always eager to pick up new skills and improve my existing ones. With the tools we have at this day and age, you can pick up pretty much anything quickly!
- ü§ù Open to Collaboration: Whether it's a simple project or a big idea, I'm open to working together and learning from others.
