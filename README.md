### Yo! 👋

Stuff contained herewith are pretty random and might be inconsistent as I try to be consistent.

After almost a decade since dropping out to move to another country, I have dearly missed my love-hate relationship with code. I have now gathered my wits and decided to focus on relearning all I that I have unlearned, starting over because I desperately need a change.

Ruby, Rails, Front-end & UX.
